BOARD STATUS: READY TO BE BUILT

MAIN COORDINATOR: [thebadseeds](https://github.com/thebadseeds)

The freeUSBi is a low-budget real-time programming device for the freeDSP and other DSP boards from Analog Devices. It is based on a CY7C68013A MINI BOARD combined with an adapter PCB (printed circuit board) that adds the possibility of realtime programming.
It has the same features as the Analog Devices USB interface (EVAL-ADUSB2EBZ), such as changing parameters while already using the freeDSP or easy changes of the schematic in SigmaStudio. You also can write your program to the EEPROM.

Please refer to the documentation for more information.
